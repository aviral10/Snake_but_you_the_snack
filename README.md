# EKANS, Its Snake, but you're the food here. 

The source code is present inside `sketch/`.
## Main concept: 
 - The snake uses a shortest path algorithm (BFS for now, will change to A* later) to get the minimum distance(avoiding obstacles) to the food and follows it aggressively.
### Run: 
 - run `npm install` to install the required libraries first
 - run `npm start` to begin serving `index.html` at `localhost`
 
 :)

 ## Instructions:
  - Use W,A,S,D to steer the food in the 2D spaces, avoiding the blocked cells
  - Control the speed of the snake using the slider, more speed == better score
  - That is pretty much it, Have fun :)
